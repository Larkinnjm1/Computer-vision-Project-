# Computer-vision-Project-
The purpose of the project was to perform computer vision project wrt to the task of face detection and facial recognition. 

Attached in the repository above you will find copies of the files utilised to create the Resnet models using both transfer learning for Resnet50 and from scratch using Resnet 34. 

Ultimately Resnet 34 was selected as the CNN to utilise due to poor validation scores during transfer learning.
